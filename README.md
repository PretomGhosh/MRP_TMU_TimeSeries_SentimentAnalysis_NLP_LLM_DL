# MRP_TMU_TimeSeries_SentimentAnalysis_NLP_LLM_DL
In this major research project, we applied a novel idea to utilize deep learning techniques and Large Language
Models to predict the sentiments and the time series prediction of stock prices. Using descriptive
analytics, I first conducted an exploratory analysis to see if I can find any patterns, correlations or
relationships in the time series pattern. Then I have predicted synthetic data for the stock prices
using two DL models and evaluated their performance. Then I have collected comments from
Stockwits API to analyze what people are thinking about that stock and did their sentiment analysis
using two LLM models. The fourth part of my analysis comes from training and evaluating four
models that could correctly predict the future prices of the stock by combining both sentiment
analysis with the time series prediction. I have used 4 different deep learning models and compared
their performance using accuracy, RMSE, MSE and MAPE. The dataset that was used to train and
evaluate the classifiers was collected from www.yahoofinance.com and from Stockwits API. The
predicted classification results were used to provide more insights about the future price of the
stock and the prediction became better and performance metrics improved when sentiment analysis was integrated with the predictive model.
